# **Loan Prediction**

**The project entails building a model that predicts if someone who seeks a loan might be a defaulter or a non-defaulter. We have several independent variables like, checking account balance, credit history, purpose, loan amount etc. Ensemble Models such as Bagging, AdaBoosting, GradientBoost, XGBoost, Random Forest etc will be used for the modelling**
